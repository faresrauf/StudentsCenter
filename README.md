Simple project using a few types of Branch that represents a students center:

GET http://localhost:3000/students/courses
GET http://localhost:3000/courses
and will add more later

Built-In modules use:
NPM installed modules
Also the app is distributed into modules to achieve modularity and clean code, in addition to maintnability. We also module object along their export property to achieve this.
